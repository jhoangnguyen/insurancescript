# InsuranceScript

## Instructions to run the script
<ol>
  <li> Go to the Google Form responses and download the results as a .zip file. </li>
  <li> Once downloaded, open the folder with this script, and put the .zip file inside of the "dist" folder. </li>
  <li> Unzip the folder. </li>
  (Note: Make sure that the name of the files that were unzipped are called "Visa Exemption Form", EXACTLY. This folder should end in .csv.)
